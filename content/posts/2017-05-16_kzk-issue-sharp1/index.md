Hi and welcome to the first issue of this newsletter!!

I really hope you find some interesting articles here, please if you know somebody that might like the newsletter please **share** with them!!!

I hope to make this newsletter in a weekly base, but you know… I don’t want to feel forced to, so maybe some issues will be bi-weekly or maybe monthly in the worst cases!

And finally if you found some links you want to share with the rest of community or you want that next issues to be more focused on specific theme just tell me.

Finally, I’m very glad to start this and see if the subscription growth and become a little community of technology engaged people.

Thankz!!! ;-)### Software Development
