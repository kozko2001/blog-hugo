in our circle of competence we know exactly what we donâ€™t know. we can make decisions fast and relatively accurate. we have ways multiple source of info we can tap


the circle of competence is not static, you can not achieve it and then move to the next thing. reality moves and that means there is new things to learn


how you build a circle of competence 
    - learning, that means when experience is meet reflection
    - but learning all by yourself, is costly and slow. learning from the experience of others is more productive
        - learn from the mistakes of others, you cannot live enough to make them all by yourself


how to behave outside your circle of competence 
    - 1. learn the basics, be aware your an stranger but basic info is normally easy to obtain and the first pieces of info rare the ones that have more value
    - 2. talk to somebody who has this circle of competence. be mindful, and take your time to do a bit of research and make questions
    - 3. try to connect your different ideas you already have ((also the mental models), to augment your limited understanding of this domai
