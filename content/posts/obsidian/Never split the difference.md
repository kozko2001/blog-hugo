### chapter 1 - THE NEW RULES



the book is written by an FBI agent specialist in hostage crisis


After time in FBI, decides to go to Harvard to deeply understand negotiation techniques


In Harvard, they are using old techniques of negotiation, related **getting to yes** a book.


These techniques, talk to the rational part of the mind.


But the FBI got a series of failures, and started to study more emphatically approach.



According to the book [Thinking,  fast and slow](../thinking-fast-and-slow) there are 2 systems.
  > System 1’s inchoate beliefs, feelings, and impressions are the main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of System 2. They’re the spring that feeds the river. We react emotionally (System 1) to a suggestion or question. 
  > Then that System 1 reaction informs and in effect creates the System 2 answer.
  - If are able to influence system 1 using our questions, system 2 (the rational) will be guided by it. 




**Life is negotiation** -> all what you are going to learn in the book is useful, even if you are not a hostage negotiator




you might have aversion of negotiation, and you should over it. Not need to like it, but understand that is how the world works.
