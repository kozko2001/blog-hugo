# Never split the difference
### chapter 1 - THE NEW RULES



the book is written by an FBI agent specialist in hostage crisis


After time in FBI, decides to go to Harvard to deeply understand negotiation techniques


In Harvard, they are using old techniques of negotiation, related **getting to yes** a book.


These techniques, talk to the rational part of the mind.


But the FBI got a series of failures, and started to study more emphatically approach.



According to the book [Thinking,  fast and slow](../thinking-fast-and-slow) there are 2 systems.
  > System 1’s inchoate beliefs, feelings, and impressions are the main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of System 2. They’re the spring that feeds the river. We react emotionally (System 1) to a suggestion or question. 
  > Then that System 1 reaction informs and in effect creates the System 2 answer.
  - If are able to influence system 1 using our questions, system 2 (the rational) will be guided by it. 




**Life is negotiation** -> all what you are going to learn in the book is useful, even if you are not a hostage negotiator




you might have aversion of negotiation, and you should over it. Not need to like it, but understand that is how the world works.


### Chapter 2



Calm the schizophrenic, listen, don't prioritize your argument, stop thinking and focus on the other person, do real active listening


The idea is to make them feel safe enough, that they talk and talk. to identify the **needs of your counterpart**.


not try to be a problem solver, but a **people mover**


going to fast can be a mistake, cause people can feel like we are not really listening, giving up all the personal relationship we built so far.

#### The voice


The voice is a important part of our comunication, and can have a big impact.


###### voices


late-night FM DJ voice
	- calm down
	- slow and clearly -> convey the idea I'm in **control**


positive/playful voice
	- most of the time
	- easigoing, good-natured person
	- attitude light and encouraging
	- smile while talking
	- when people are in a positive frame of mind, they think quickly and is easy for collaborate, instead of resist


assertive voice
	- very rare cases to use it,
	

##### mirroring


is essentially imitation, 


we copy each other to comfort each other


it's unconscious
	- personal: like when I go to Menorca and my catalan accent changes


mirroring, when done with consciously is **the art of insinuating similarity**.
	- "Trust me", " You and I we're alike"


By repeting back (the last 3 words or the critical words). you trigger this mirroring insting and your counterpart will inevitably elaborate on what was just said, while sustaining the process of connecting


The intention behind most mirrors should be "Please, help me understand"

### Chapter 3 - Don't feel their pain, label it



good negotiators don't deny or ignore emotions, they identify and influence them
	- They are able to precisely label them
	- and once labeled, they talk about them without getting wound up (agitated)
	- emotions is a tool

##### tactical empathy


empathy is `the ability to recognize the perspective of a counterpart, and the vocalization of that recognition`
	- so, basically empaty is paying attention to another human being, and commiting to understand their world


one step beyond that is **tactical empathy**
	- empathy
	- but also hearing what is behind those feelings
	- so you increase your influence in all the moments that follow
	- bringing our attentiotn to both, the emotional obstacles, and the potential pathways to getting an agreement done.


empathy is **not about being nice or agreeing with the other side**. It's about understand them, understand their position why their actions make sense and what forces move them.

##### Labeling



Labeling is a way of validating someone's emotion by acknowledging it.
	- Think of labeling as a shortcut to intimacy, a time-saving emotional hack


Labeling has a special advantage when your counterpart is tense
	- exposing negative thought to daylight
	- makes them seem less frightening


Labeling allow you to diffuse negative aspects, and reinforce good ones.



Labels almost always being with roughly the same words
	- (It seems like, it sounds like, it looks like)
	- notice we don't use **I**, cause I get people guard up (seems like you are more interested in yourself)


Then you just wait, **silence and listen**
	- if you are right, they will explain
	- if you are not right, you can just say, "I didn't say that was what it was. I just said it seems like that"



People emotions have two levels
	- **presenting**: what you can see and hear
	- **underlying**: what motivate the behavior


Labeling negative emotions diffuses them, labeling positives reinforces them

##### accusation audit

1. List all the bad things your counterpart could say about you.
2. label the emotions of
3. and provide a replace with good ones

> In case you're about volunteering to role-play with me in front of the class, I want to tell you in advance, it's going to be horrible. But those of you who do volunteer will probably get more out of this than anyone else.



Remember you're dealing with a person who want to be appreciated and understood. So use labels to reinforce and encourage positive perceptions and dynamics.
