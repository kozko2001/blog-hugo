# Never split the difference
### chapter 1 - THE NEW RULES



the book is written by an FBI agent specialist in hostage crisis


After time in FBI, decides to go to Harvard to deeply understand negotiation techniques


In Harvard, they are using old techniques of negotiation, related **getting to yes** a book.


These techniques, talk to the rational part of the mind.


But the FBI got a series of failures, and started to study more emphatically approach.



According to the book [Thinking,  fast and slow](../thinking-fast-and-slow) there are 2 systems.
  > System 1’s inchoate beliefs, feelings, and impressions are the main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of System 2. They’re the spring that feeds the river. We react emotionally (System 1) to a suggestion or question. 
  > Then that System 1 reaction informs and in effect creates the System 2 answer.
  - If are able to influence system 1 using our questions, system 2 (the rational) will be guided by it. 




**Life is negotiation** -> all what you are going to learn in the book is useful, even if you are not a hostage negotiator




you might have aversion of negotiation, and you should over it. Not need to like it, but understand that is how the world works.

### chapter 2 - Be a mirror



## Highlight of the book

### Chapter 2



Calm the schizophrenic, listen, don't priotarize your argument, stop thinking and focus on the other person, do real active listening


The idea is to make them feel safe enough, that they talk and talk. to identify the **needs of your counterpart**.


not try to be a problem solver, but a **people mover**


going to fast can be a mistake, cause people can feel like we are not really listening, giving up all the personal relationship we built so far.

#### The voice


The voice is a important part of our comunication, and can have a big impact.



late-night FM DJ voice
	- calm down
	- slow and clearly -> convey the idea I'm in **control**


positive/playful voice
	- most of the time
	- easigoing, good-natured person
	- attitude light and encouraging
	- smile while talking
	- when people are in a positive frame of mind, they think quickly and is easy for collaborate, instead of resist


assertive voice
	- very rare cases to use it,
	-

Good negotiators, going in, know they have to be ready for possible surprises; great negotiators aim to use their skills to reveal the surprises they are certain exist.



Too often people find it easier just to stick with what they believe. Using what they’ve heard or their own biases, they often make assumptions about others even before meeting them. They even ignore their own perceptions to make them conform to foregone conclusions. These assumptions muck up our perceptual windows onto the world, showing us an unchanging—often flawed—version of the situation. Great negotiators are able to question the assumptions that the rest of the involved players accept on faith or in arrogance, and thus remain more emotionally open to all possibilities, and more intellectually agile to a fluid situation.



I hadn’t yet learned to be aware of a counterpart’s overuse of personal pronouns—we/they or me/I. The less important he makes himself, the more important he probably is (and vice versa).



There’s one powerful way to quiet the voice in your head and the voice in their head at the same time: treat two schizophrenics with just one pill. Instead of prioritizing your argument—in fact, instead of doing any thinking at all in the early goings about what you’re going to say—make your sole and all-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say. In that mode of true active listening—aided by the tactics you’ll learn in the following chapters—you’ll disarm your counterpart. You’ll make them feel safe. The voice in their head will begin to quiet down.



The goal is to identify what your counterparts actually need (monetarily, emotionally, or otherwise) and get them feeling safe enough to talk and talk and talk some more about what they want. The latter will help you discover the former. Wants are easy to talk about, representing the aspiration of getting our way, and sustaining any illusion of control we have as we begin to negotiate; needs imply survival, the very minimum required to make us act, and so make us vulnerable.



neither wants nor needs are where we start; it begins with listening, making it about the other people, validating their emotions, and creating enough trust and safety for a real conversation to begin.



The approach was half MSU—Making Shit Up—and half a sort of sales approach—basically trying to persuade, coerce, or manipulate in any way possible.



trying to be a problem solver, not a people mover.



Going too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiators are prone to making. If we’re too much in a hurry, people can feel as if they’re not being heard and we risk undermining the rapport and trust we’ve built.



There are essentially three voice tones available to negotiators: the late-night FM DJ voice, the positive/playful voice, and the direct or assertive voice.



Most of the time, you should be using the positive/playful voice. It’s the voice of an easygoing, good-natured person. Your attitude is light and encouraging. The key here is to relax and smile while you’re talking. A smile, even while talking on the phone, has an impact tonally that the other person will pick up on.



When people are in a positive frame of mind, they think more quickly, and are more likely to collaborate and problem-solve (instead of fight and resist). It applies to the smile-er as much as to the smile-ee: a smile on your face, and in your voice, will increase your own mental agility.



Talking slowly and clearly you convey one idea: I’m in control. When you inflect in an upward way, you invite a response.



Mirroring, also called isopraxism, is essentially imitation. It’s another neurobehavior humans (and other animals) display in which we copy each other to comfort each other. It can be done with speech patterns, body language, vocabulary, tempo, and tone of voice. It’s generally an unconscious behavior—we are rarely aware of it when it’s happening—but it’s a sign that people are bonding, in sync, and establishing the kind of rapport that leads to trust.



We fear what’s different and are drawn to what’s similar.



Mirroring, then, when practiced consciously, is the art of insinuating similarity. “Trust me,” a mirror signals to another’s unconscious, “You and I—we’re alike.”



By repeating back what people say, you trigger this mirroring instinct and your counterpart will inevitably elaborate on what was just said and sustain the process of connecting.



Just the words. It’s almost laughably simple: for the FBI, a “mirror” is when you repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said.



I only half-jokingly refer to mirroring as magic or a Jedi mind trick because it gives you the ability to disagree without being disagreeable.



If you take a pit bull approach with another pit bull, you generally end up with a messy scene and lots of bruised feelings and resentment. Luckily, there’s another way without all the mess.

but to deliver the mirror in an inquisitive tone. The intention behind most mirrors should be “Please, help me understand.”
