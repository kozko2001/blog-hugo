# Chapter 1

Bosses **guide** a **team** to achieve **results**

**Guidance**: or feedback -> often we don't give good guidancecause we don't know how the other will receive it (fear of being socially awkward, I am being to nice or too mean? )

**Team Building**: Figuring out right people for the right role (hiring, firing, promoting). And when the team is set... how to have them motivated.

**Results**:

> Relationship, and no power, drive you forward


Radical candor is based in two "sentences":
**Care personally**: Being more than a professional, to have good relationship you have to care as a human being not as a worker.
**Challenge directly**: Tell the team, when their work is not good enough


# Chapter 2 
![](<../radical_candor.png>)

- difference between **radical candor** and **obnoxious aggression** is:
	-  it's not mean, it's clear
	-  no belittle embarrass people in public
- Most people prefer a challenging jerk than a nice incompetent.
- How to start the wheel of feedback, start asking for feedback (give example) and when start giving it, start  by praising
- If a person is bold enough to give you feedback, do not critique their criticism
- people who are more concern for the** right answer**, instrad if **being right** are better bosses.
- Not personalize the feedback, instead of  "When they are not good enough" say "When their work is not good enough"

# Chapter 3

understand what motivates each person on your team

- **Rockstar** (is rock solid)
