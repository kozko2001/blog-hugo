> 2. Challenging assumptions

> 3. Looking for evidences

> 4. Considering alternative perspectives (What might others think? How do I know I am correct?)

> 5. Examining consequences and implications ( What are the consequences if I am wrong?)

> 6. Questioning the original questions (Why did I think that? was I correct?)
