- the map of reality is not reality. not the best map. if it was so accurate it will also continue the map itself and would be as complex as reality
- maps are reductions of reality. to help us to understand the reality and make decisions without having to understand all the territory. most of the times we just need good enough information
- the truth is we can only navigate the complex reality through some abstraction.
- but was useful the maps are. we have to understand that they are not the reality. we can not ignore the feedback loops that validates our understanding of the world and the reality
- we should understand the limitations of the map
- we can us maps to guide us, but we must not let them prevent us from discovering new territory or updating our maps
- in order to use a map we should consider
    - reality is the ultimate update
    - consider the cartographer : for example, what you know from the news are maps of the reality, but depending on who made the map, it will contain different biases
    - maps can influence territory =>
