# Atomic Habits

## Chapter 1 - The surprising power of atomic habits

- Habits are compound interest of self-improvement
- Sadly, the feedback look of habit is slow paced, makes easier to have bad habits
- Put your eye in the process (and where it will lead you) than in the current result. 
	- It's hard to have good habits that last, cause we fail to see tangible results, and in a weak moment we decide to stop
	- But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through the Plateu of Latent Potential
- Time magnifies the margin between success and failure, having small good habit is going to make time your ally.

## Chapter 2 - How your habits shape your identity

Why is changing habits so hard? Cause we try to change for an outcome.

There is 3 levels of change that can occur

1. Outcome: ex. losing weight, publishing a book
2. Processes: changing your habits and systems, ex. decluttering your desk 
3. Identity: changing your beliefs, how you see the world, yourself and others
