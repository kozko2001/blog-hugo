> in our circle of competence we know exactly what we don’t know. we can make decisions fast and relatively accurate. we have ways multiple source of info we can tap

> 

> the circle of competence is not static, you can not achieve it and then move to the next thing. reality moves and that means there is new things to learn

> 

> 

> how you build a circle of competence 

>   - learning, that means when experience is meet reflection

>   - but learning all by yourself, is costly and slow. learning from the experience of others is more productive

>       - learn from the mistakes of others, you cannot live enough to make them all by yourself

> 

> 

> how to behave outside your circle of competence 

>   - 1. learn the basics, be aware your an stranger but basic info is normally easy to obtain and the first pieces of info rare the ones that have more value

>   - 2. talk to somebody who has this circle of competence. be mindful, and take your time to do a bit of research and make questions

>   - 3. try to connect your different ideas you already have ((also the mental models), to augment your limited understanding of this domain

> Thought experiments allow us to dig deeper on "What if" questions allowing us to:

> 

> 

> Improve our understanding of the world, by making thinking what if... and then check how the world would change. Also tells you a lot of what you don't know

> 

> 

> Get consciousness of our plan, for example I buy 1000 of stock, what if, starts going up 10% in a single day? should I sell? what if goes down but little by little? etc..  

> 

> 

> Allow us to do impracticable experiments, i.e if you have a car without control, and you can choose between turning right you kill a single person or doing nothing and hitting 5 persons. You don't want to make this kind of experiments in the real world

> Our actions have consequences that normally we can predict, this is *First order thinking*, but we want also to understand the ripples that our actions that might eclipse the benefits first order benefit.

> 

> > People don't consider the effects of the effects

> 

> Always ask yourself **“And then what?”**

> 

> Second order thinking is not predicting the future, you can only predict likely events that will occur with the information you have now. However not being able to predict the future, is not an excuse to not consider the second order outcomes.

> 

> This is a useful model for seeing past immediate gains and identify long term gains. 

> 

> Also it's a useful model for *[Persuasion](../persuasion)*, showing that you had make into account the effects of effects, shows that you had a much deeper thought of the idea.
