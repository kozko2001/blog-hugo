from wikipedia:

> The broken windows theory is a criminological theory that states that visible signs of crime, anti-social behavior, and civil disorder create an urban environment that encourages further crime and disorder.

Basically is a way of saying that if there is a show of bad habit in a group,  it will spread and go deeper.

Why? easy! If I have to do an effort to do an effort to makke things properly, For example once I finished my card, I know that I should is to refactor the code so it's clear for next person. But then Iook at the code around me, and I see pieces that are really ugly. Anybody will just think... okay it's a bit of the same, who cares.

### Conclusion


The behavior of the group, will be the easiest one in the group. Meaning if there is 5 persons and a single one is cheating/skipping a behavior, the whole group will skip.


Be aware of the exceptions you make for short term goals, they can destroy long term goals
