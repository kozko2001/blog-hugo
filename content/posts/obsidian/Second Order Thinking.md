Our actions have consequences that normally we can predict, this is *First order thinking*, but we want also to understand the ripples that our actions that might eclipse the benefits first order benefit.

> People don't consider the effects of the effects

Always ask yourself **“And then what?”**

Second order thinking is not predicting the future, you can only predict likely events that will occur with the information you have now. However not being able to predict the future, is not an excuse to not consider the second order outcomes.

This is a useful model for seeing past immediate gains and identify long term gains. 

Also it's a useful model for *[Persuasion](../persuasion)*, showing that you had make into account the effects of effects, shows that you had a much deeper thought of the idea.
