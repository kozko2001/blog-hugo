Thought experiments allow us to dig deeper on "What if" questions allowing us to:


Improve our understanding of the world, by making thinking what if... and then check how the world would change. Also tells you a lot of what you don't know


Get consciousness of our plan, for example I buy 1000 of stock, what if, starts going up 10% in a single day? should I sell? what if goes down but little by little? etc..  


Allow us to do impracticable experiments, i.e if you have a car without control, and you can choose between turning right you kill a single person or doing nothing and hitting 5 persons. You don't want to make this kind of experiments in the real world
