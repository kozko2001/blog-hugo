- Lonely genius vs scenius (a scene of people with common interests )
	- Start thinking what we can do for others

	- We are afraid of being revealed as an amateur. But it's actually good cause you have little to lose and willing to share the results
		- In the beginners mind there are many possibilities, in the experts mind there are few
	- You can go from mediacre to good with increments, the real gap is from doing nothing to something 
	- The world's is changing so fast thatis turning all of us into amateurs
	- The best way to start sharing is to think something you want to learn and make a commitment in front of others
