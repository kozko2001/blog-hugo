- Lonely genius vs scenius (a scene of people with common interests )
	- Start thinking what we can do for others
	- Connect with an raceme is easier than never. The internet is a bunch os scenes
	- We are afraid of being revealed as an amateur. But it's actually good cause you have little to lose and willing to share the results
		- In the beginners mind there are many possibilities, in the experts mind there are few
	- You can go from mediacre to good with increments, the real gap is from doing nothing to something 
	- The world's is changing so fast thatis turning all of us into amateurs
	- The best way to start sharing is to think something you want to learn and make a commitment in front of others

## chapter 3

- Share a little each day
	- Block sometime, reflect on what you did today and share
	- Don't share anything, 
		- Share like if everybody could fire you
		- Is it interesting? Is it useful?
		- If not sure, better o save it for later
	- Stock and flow
		- Stock is content that is as useful today that in 2 years, is content audience search for it
		- Flow is the stream of daily content
		- Create a balance between both, patterns will emerge from your flow, you can organize them to create stock
## chapter 4
- During years we build up aa mental scratch book, what we like, what we follow, who is our hero
	- That influence is worth sharing
	- If you like something, don't hide it,don't think what others will think about it, be honest
