What is little's principle? {{c1:: 
Is a theorem from queue system that says 
- L => avg. Number of things in a queue 
- lambda => avg. Rate of new items to the queue
- W => average time for processing the item

$$L = lambda * W$$

You can think of it from the point of view of agile teams as well.

- L => how many in progress or **WIP**
- lambda => Avg time we get new things **in progress**
- W => avg time to get a task to done **Lead Time**
