- Today I just discovered that KeepassXC, can do something I used to be envying of my pals that have been using 1password. There is a functionality named Auto-Type, which will auto-fill the user and password for not just web pages but also for apps.
- You can check the manual to set it up ( https://keepassxc.org/docs/KeePassXC_UserGuide.html#_auto_type), I did change my global binding to be special hard to hit on other apps.
