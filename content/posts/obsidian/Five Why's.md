### Five Why's

It's a way to depth on what you know, and what you don't know. trying to understand the world as a 5 year does. Asking compulsively Why every time.

The idea is to get the main idea we want to deep, and ask Why is this true? and what ever the answer is, ask again: **Why?**

If in any of the answers you get to a **"cause this is how it is"** or **Cause yes**. You found an assumption that you need to check.
