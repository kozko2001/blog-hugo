 What is an eigenvector? Eigenvectors is a decomposition of a matrix, where we multiply the matrix by a vector, and the result is the same vector multiplied by an scalar $$A*\vec{v} = \lambda * \vec{v}$$  
 
 What is the geometric explanation of eigenvectors? it will tell you, which directions while not change when using the transformation matrix `A`, the eigenvectors will not change direction, they will only stretch by the factor of the eigenvalue ($$ \lambda $$)
